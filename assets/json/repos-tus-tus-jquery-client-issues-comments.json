    "body": "@srijs thanks - I actually came across this before but forgot to bookmark it! We'll definitely check it out.\r\n\r\nBtw. we'll also look into rusha for fingerprinting. It's probably still not practical to use it for large files, but it might be interesting to sample a file with it. However, simpler checksum algorithms may ultimately be better for this use case as false positives wouldn't be the end of the world, and there is nothing to gain for an attacker by causing an intentional collision (after all, he already has the tus upload url in local storage).\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you'd like to chat about upload stuff at some point, I'd love to exchange ideas! Just let me know.\r\n\r\nAlso say hello to Sascha from me : )"

    "body": "Rusha is actually quite okay for fingerprinting. In experiments we were hashing not the files as a whole, but in 4MB chunks. This allows for continuos uploading while doing (block-based) de-duplication on-the-fly.\r\nUsing this method over the loop-back interface and utilizing ~1 1.7GHz i5 core we were able to upload (in Firefox Nightly) with ~70MB/s and in current Chrome 25.0 with ~24MB/s. This should be enough for common bandwidths.\r\nIf you're interested I could make the source of this experiment available to you...\r\n\r\nAnyway, since I am interested in extending Rusha beyond SHA1, I would also be interested in working with you on a simpler message digest implementation (with rusha-like performance, of course ;)) once you settled for one...\r\n\r\nI'd love to exchange some ideas with you and could also, for sure, answer some of your questions regarding resumable.js...\r\n\r\nI'll tell him ;)"

    "body": "@srijs I think anything > 5 MBit/sec would be viable for fingerprinting. Ideally we'd have something that can do 100 MBit/sec on commodity hardware / all plattforms. Your numbers look like 100 MBit/sec is indeed doable for Chrome/FF, so that's really exciting!\r\n\r\nAs far as simpler digest goes: I'm not sure what your requirements are. For example we only have to be able to determine a reasonably unique fingerprint for files selected via a file input element. This fingerprint needs to be unique for the machine/browser it is generated on, but doesn't have to be unique enough to do server-side de-duplication. This probably means our current approach (file name + size + modified date + etc.) is good enough for our use case, but not suitable for what you're trying to do?\r\n\r\n"
