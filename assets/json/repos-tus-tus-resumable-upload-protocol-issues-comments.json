    "body": "> Some HTTP frameworks I came across won't accept Content-Length values over a signed 32bit integer (2147483647 bytes, 2GB).\r\n\r\nThat seems client specific. But these clients could simply use 2GB as a chunk size instead of uploading the entire file during PUT requests?\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, the RFC mandates that the Content-Length header must be ignored if the transfer encoding is anything but identity (i.e. chunked transfer encoding):\r\n\r\nThe protocol currently says that `Content-Length` is required, so it seems that in accordance with RFC 2616, transfer codings can't be used with the protocol at this point.

I understand that chunked transfer encoding is great when you don't know the size beforehand but going as far as making a non-identity transfer-encoding and *Content-Length* header mutually exclusive is just silly (but I'm sure they must have had their reasons...).\r\n\r\nFor instance, on Droplr the server is currently violating that rule as I always need to know the size of the file before allowing the upload (user may have no more space, file may be too large for the free accounts, etc). It was either that or not supporting chunked transfer encoding at all. Since this is to become a more widely used standard you'll need a more elegant solution."

    "body": "@awendt thank you so much for this feedback, these are good points indeed!\r\n\r\nRegarding the `Range` header, [section 14.35](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16) starts out by saying:\r\n\r\n> Since all HTTP entities are represented in HTTP messages as sequences of bytes, the concept of a byte range is meaningful for any HTTP entity.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think that the `Range` header is also allowed for responses. At least I could not find anything in the spec that says it's forbidden. Using `Range` for the responses is mainly desirable as it allows for multiple ranges to be returned, giving clients the ability to upload parts of a file in parallel as well as out of order (not part of the protocol yet, but will be added soon). Additionally the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/using_resumable_upload_protocol#Handle_Response_to_Status_Request) serves as prior art for using the `Range` header this way and gives me reason to believe this will work well with existing http clients and libraries.\r\n\r\n> Why do you use \"Range\" for the response and \"Content-Range\" for the request?\r\n\r\nIt's a simular situation as for the `Range` header, the http spec has no example of using it for a request, but it seems to be the right choice given the `Content-Range` header [definition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16):\r\n\r\n> The Content-Range entity-header is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied. Range units are defined in section 3.12.\r\n\r\nI actually think that the http specification generally does not distinguish between request/response headers, and many headers make sense for both (e.g. `Content-Length`).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

    "body": "> Regarding the Range header, section 14.35 starts out by saying:\r\n> > Since all HTTP entities are represented in HTTP messages as sequences of bytes, the concept of a byte range is meaningful for any HTTP entity.\r\n\r\nI believe this statement is referring to the different types of entities (say a text entity vs a binary image entity), all of which can be meaningfully sampled with a range of bytes. It's not saying the range header can apply to both message types (request messages and response messages). An entity is the payload of a message - they're not the same thing.\r\n\r\nIf you look at [the ABNF grammar for a response](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6), you'll see that [request-headers](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.3) are clearly not permitted there. If Range was meant to be applicable to both request and response messages, it would have been included in the [entity-header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7.1) set.\r\n\r\n> I actually think that the http specification generally does not distinguish between request/response headers, and many headers make sense for both (e.g. Content-Length).\r\n\r\nThe headers that apply to both are either [general-headers](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.5) or [entity-headers](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7.1)."

    "body": "Sounds good. Just a sanity check to see if I'm following along: \r\n\r\n* Client reports its going to upload a 5GB file\r\n* Client PUTs two chunks of 2GB-1 (here you should probably return 202 ACCEPTED, reserve 201 CREATED/200 OK for the final response)\r\n* Client PUTs final 1GB chunk and gets OK from the server\r\n\r\nSo, assuming there were no *Content-Length* limits, it'd be nearly the same as trying to upload a 5GB file at once with failures occurring at the 2 and 4GB boundaries (which would lead to retries but in this case are answered with \"ok, got this chunk, proceed\")... Yeah, this looks great!"

It's a complex subject, but for anybody who is interested:\r\n\r\n* [J. Stone et. al., \"Performance of Checksums and CRC's over Real Data\" 1998](ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/mbgreen/papers/ton98.pdf) looks at the checksum algorithm used by TCP and compares it with CRC\r\n* [RFC3385 Internet Protocol Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)/Checksum Considerations](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3385) compares CRC to alternative checksums (but not the one used by TCP)\r\n\r\nThe tl;dr; is: TCP checksums are quite weak by modern standards, but layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet/Wifi/PPP have their own CRC checksums and will drop bad frames which TCP will detect and retransmit. So in order for a TCP frame with corrupted data to reach our BSD sockets, it will require both the weak and the stronger mechanism to fail at the same time - which should be quite rare. (unfortunately I don't have time to quantify \"quite rare\" further, it would be quite a little math side project).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFelix"

    "body": "> IMHO the first draft should focus on solving the problem of resumable uploads and leave the parallel resumable uploads for v2.\r\n\r\nI think it should be in v1. Clients not supporting this feature will work with servers that support it by default (as the server will only return one range), and the scenario where clients support the feature but the server doesn't can be solved by requiring clients to make the parallel uploading configurable.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

    "body": "Working on a \"contractual exchange of high value assets\" system (~ $50 * 10**12/year) we did the maths and figured worst case noisy lines you might see a 2+-bit error (all single bit errors will be caught by the TCP checksum) once in 10**12 bytes (1 terabyte transferred) on a raw socket, so we added an extra 32-bit checksum per binary message (~100-1000 bytes, multiple messages per TCP packet, and they can cross packet boundaries).\r\n\r\nWe figured this pushed the error rate out to something close to 10**40 which is my unofficial \"ain't never gonna happen\" figure (c.f. age of the universe in seconds ~ 10**17).\r\n\r\nOh and then we added IPSec (ESP+AH) to the parts of the network we controlled and SSL to the entire end-to-end comms, and as you note, the checksums from other layers work too and they will each tend to catch bad data, but with big money changing hands we really didn't want to take chances.\r\n"
