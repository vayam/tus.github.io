	<p>This is a minor protocol release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/pull/19">#19</a>:
Final-Length header was called Final-Size in one place by accident. (<a href="https://github.com/vayam">Naren
Venkataraman</a>)</li>
<li>Define that PATCH requests MUST use <code>application/offset+octet-stream</code> as the
<code>Content-Type</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/felixge">Felix Geisendörfer</a>)</li>
<li>Define that <code>Final-Length</code> values MUST NOT be negative. (<a href="https://github.com/felixge">Felix
Geisendörfer</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>All patches can be seen <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/compare/v0.2...v0.2.1">here</a>.</p>

	<p>After releasing our first draft a few weeks ago, we received an incredible
amount of feedback and suggestions. Based on this feedback as well as
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013AprJun/0155.html">discussing</a>
the problems with the <a href="http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/wiki">IETF HTTPbis Working
Group</a>, we identified a few
key issues with <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/blob/v0.1/README.md">v0.1</a> of the
protocol:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>PUT</code> requests are not appropiate for transfering partial resources</li>
<li>The <code>Content-Range</code> and <code>Range</code> headers are not meant for resuming an
interrupted resource transfer.</li>
</ul>

<p>After lots of careful thinking, we came up with a new approach that uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>PATCH</code> instead of <code>PUT</code></li>
<li>A new <code>Offset</code> header used by <code>HEAD</code> responses and <code>PATCH</code> requests alike</li>
<li>A <code>Final-Length</code> header to provide the final file size to the server</li>
</ul>

<p>We also split the protocol into a core protocol which takes care of
resumability, and nothing else, as well as optional protocol extensions.</p>

<p>The result of this has just been published as v0.2 can be seen on the <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">protocol
page</a>. Also included is a new <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html#7">FAQ
section</a> which will expanded over time.</p>

<p>We feel that the overall result is a drastic simplification of the problem down
to its essence, and we encourage interested developers to implement prototypes.</p>

<p>Our next step is upgrading tusd, the jquery client and the ios client to the
new protocol version. Once the protocol has reached a little more maturity, we
are also thinking about providing an executable protocol verification tool for
implementers.</p>

	<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> We are happy to announce version 0.1 of the <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">tus resumable upload
protocol</a> and are interested in your
feedback!</p>

<p>With mobile devices becoming the dominant source of user generated media files,
reliable file uploading through unreliable mobile networks has become an
important issue for anybody interested in content acquisition.</p>

<p>Reliability here means the ability to detect network errors, and resuming an
upload without having to start from the beginning. In many scenarios this can
mean the difference between a file reaching your application, or the user
giving up in frustration.</p>

<p>Ideally, this should be a trivial feature to add. In reality however, there is
quite a lack of solutions in this space. Sure, there are a few JavaScript
libraries that claim to support resumable uploading, but in reality you will
end up spending a lot of time coming up with your own API for it, or
implementing a poorly specified one specific to a library. This is incredibly
frustrating, especially if you are planning to support this feature on multiple
platforms such as HTML5, iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Now, if you&#39;re a big company like Google, you may sit down and create such a
protocol for your needs. And in fact, Google has been working on a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gears/wiki/ResumableHttpRequestsProposal">such a
protocol</a>
since 2010, for the now defunct Google Gears. The latest incarnation of this
are two incompatible protocols for <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/manage-uploads">Google
Drive</a> and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/using_resumable_upload_protocol">YouTube</a>.
But unfortunately both of these protocols rely on a non-standard http status
code (<code>308 Resume Incomplete</code>), and are far from being generic enough for
general adoption.</p>

<p>This means that smaller companies are currently doomed to invent, implement and
maintain their own incompatible protocols and solutions for something that
should be a trivial component of a modern application.</p>

<p>We find this unacceptable, so the <a href="http://www.tus.io/">tus project</a> is a
community project that was born in order to level the playing field and make
resumable file uploading easy for anybody to implement.</p>

<p>Today we are happy to release version 0.1 of <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">our
protocol</a>. Interested developers are
encouraged to experiment with it, and we are very interested in any feedback
you may have.</p>

<p>Later this week we will also release some initial clients for
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-jquery-client">jQuery</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-ios-client">iOS</a>, so make sure to follow this blog
and these repositories for future updates!</p>

	<p>Hey everybody, we&#39;re starting a new blog here to discuss file uploading, and
the protocol we are working on. So keep an eye on this space!</p>
